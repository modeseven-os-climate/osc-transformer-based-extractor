What is the total volume of proven and probable hydrocarbons reserves?,"Natural resources 11,096 Proved oil and gas reserves (million boe) [B]",0
What is the total amount of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases emissions?,"Natural resources 11,096 Proved oil and gas reserves (million boe) [B]",0
In which year was the annual report or the sustainability report published?,"Although we have no immediate plans to move to a net-zero emissions
portfolio, in November of 2017, we announced our ambition to reduce
our Net Carbon Footprint in step with society’s progress towards the
Paris Agreement’s goal of holding the rise in global average temperatures
this century to well below 2°C above pre‑industrial levels. Accordingly,
assuming society aligns itself with the Paris Agreement’s goals, we aim to
reduce our Net Carbon Footprint, which includes not only our direct and
indirect carbon emissions, associated with producing the energy products
which we sell, but also our customers’ emissions from their use of the
energy products that we sell, by around 20% in 2035 and by around
50% in 2050.",0
